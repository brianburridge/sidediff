== Side Diff

The following app is a prototype of a side-by-side diff of two files.

The app uses the [Diff LCS Gem](https://github.com/halostatue/diff-lcs) for the diff engine.

Currently the prototype compares two local files.

The CSS/HTML was first prototype out on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/bburridge/pen/vxIBH).

== Next Steps

1. Allow user to browser for local files for the comparison.

2. Mark changes within a line.

3. Refactor to use a Value Object.
